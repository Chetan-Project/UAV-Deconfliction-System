# System Architecture

## Overview

The UAV Deconfliction System is designed as a modular, scalable solution for managing UAV flight paths in shared airspace. The system implements 4D (3D space + time) conflict detection and resolution.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Layer
- `Drone`: Represents UAVs with waypoints and mission parameters
- `Waypoint`: 4D coordinates (x, y, z, t) with timestamps
- `ConflictPoint`: Represents potential conflict points in 4D space-time

### 2. Logic Layer
- `DeconflictionSystem`: Manages conflict detection and resolution
- Implements spatial and temporal validation
- Uses caching for performance optimization

### 3. Visualization Layer
- Real-time 3D visualization of drone trajectories
- Conflict visualization
- Mission status display

### 4. Utility Layer
- Logging and error handling
- Configuration management
- Data validation

## Key Features

### 4D Space-Time Analysis
- Spatial separation with safety buffer
- Temporal separation for mission overlap
- Combined spatial-temporal conflict detection

### Performance Optimization
- KDTree for efficient spatial indexing
- Temporal indexing for time-based queries
- Caching for repeated calculations

### Scalability
- Modular design for easy extension
- Efficient data structures
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory optimization

## Integration Points

### Input/Output
- Mission planning integration
- Real-time data feeds
- Conflict resolution outputs

### External Systems
- Weather data integration
- Airspace management systems
- Flight planning systems

## Security Considerations

- Data validation and sanitization
- Access control
- Audit logging
- Error handling and recovery
