# UAV Strategic Deconfliction System - Reflection Document

## 1. Design Decisions

### 1.1 Core Architecture
The system was designed with a modular approach, separating concerns into distinct components:
- `drone.py`: Handles drone and waypoint data structures
- `deconfliction.py`: Implements core validation logic
- `visualization.py`: Manages visualization capabilities
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions and logging

### 1.2 Spatial and Temporal Validation
- Implemented KDTree for efficient spatial queries
- Added time-based indexing to reduce unnecessary spatial checks
- Used caching to avoid redundant calculations
- Configurable safety buffer for flexible collision detection

### 1.3 Visualization
- 3D visualization using matplotlib
- Animation capabilities for dynamic trajectory visualization
- Conflict highlighting with distinct markers
- Performance metrics visualization

## 2. AI Integration

### 2.1 Spatial Indexing
- Used KDTree from scipy for efficient nearest neighbor searches
- Optimized spatial queries with O(log n) complexity
- Maintains spatial index for dynamic updates

### 2.2 Time-based Optimization
- Implemented time-based indexing to filter potential conflicts
- Reduces computational complexity by eliminating unnecessary checks
- Maintains temporal consistency across validations

## 3. Testing Strategy

### 3.1 Test Cases
- No conflict scenarios
- Spatial conflicts only
- Temporal conflicts only
- Full spatio-temporal conflicts
- Edge cases (boundary conditions)

### 3.2 Performance Testing
- Benchmarking with varying numbers of drones
- Timing measurements for validation operations
- Memory usage tracking

## 4. Edge Cases

### 4.1 Handled Cases
