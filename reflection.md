# UAV Deconfliction System Reflection

## 1. Design Decisions and Architecture

### 1.1 Core Architecture
The system is built as a modular, scalable solution with clear separation of concerns:

- **Data Layer**: Drone and Waypoint classes handle data representation and validation
- **Logic Layer**: DeconflictionSystem manages conflict detection and resolution
- **Visualization Layer**: Handles 3D plotting and animation
- **Utility Layer**: Provides common functions and logging

### 1.2 Key Design Decisions

#### 4D Space-Time Representation
- Implemented using tuples for (x, y, z, t) coordinates
- Safety buffer of 10 meters for spatial separation
- 15-minute temporal separation for temporal conflicts

#### Caching Strategy
- Implemented LRU caching for spatial and temporal checks
- Cache keys use drone IDs for uniqueness
- Cache invalidation on drone addition/removal

#### Indexing
- Spatial Index using KDTree for efficient nearest neighbor search
- Temporal Index using dictionary for time-based lookups
- Combined spatial-temporal queries for optimized performance

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1 Spatial Check Implementation
- Uses KDTree for O(log n) nearest neighbor search

- Applies safety buffer for conflict detection
- Caches results to avoid redundant calculations

### 2.2 Temporal Check Implementation
- Uses time-based indexing for efficient temporal lookups
- Checks for overlapping time ranges between drones
- Considers both start and end times of missions
- Implements temporal safety buffer
