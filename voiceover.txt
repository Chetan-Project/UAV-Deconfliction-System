Welcome to the UAV Strategic Deconfliction System demonstration.

[0:00-0:15]
This system uses advanced 4D analysis to detect and prevent conflicts between drone missions in shared airspace.

[0:15-0:30]
First, we see two drones maintaining safe distances in both space and time. The system uses a spatial index and KDTree algorithm to validate their trajectories in real-time.

[0:30-0:45]
Next, we demonstrate a spatial conflict where two drones' paths come too close in 3D space. The system identifies the potential collision point using a safety buffer of 50 meters and explains the risk.

[0:45-1:00]
In this temporal conflict scenario, we see drones occupying the same space at different times. The system uses temporal indexing to ensure safe separation of at least 15 minutes between missions.

[1:00-1:15]
This demonstration showcases our UAV deconfliction system's ability to detect and resolve conflicts in 4D space-time, using advanced caching and indexing techniques for optimal performance.
